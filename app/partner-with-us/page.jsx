      Uolo works with medium to large scale corporations to deploy their CSR
      funds for well defined programs in affordable private schools (APS).

      </p>
      <p className='text-[#475467] text-[16px] sm:text-xl py-4'>
      Affordable private schools charge Rs. 2000 per month or less as fees from
their students. These are well meaning not-for-profit organizations, at times
run by passionate teams but almost always short of funds to invest in
technology based interventions to improve learning outcomes of students.

      </p>
      <p className='text-[#475467] text-[16px] sm:text-xl py-4'>
      With Uolo, companies can use their CSR fund to help the schools implement
Uolo offering. We believe that it is important for all stake-holders to be
sufficiently vested in running a CSR program to see real learning outcomes.
Consequently, the structure of the CSR initiative is 33% contribution by
company, 33% contribution by the school and 34% by Uolo.

      </p>

     <div className=' bg-[#E3DAFB] font-normal p-4 rounded-2xl '>
        <p>
     We also have experience running CSR program in government schools
where the contribution by the company is 66% and 34% by Uolo. If you wish
to partner with us for your CSR initiative, you can write to us at:  {" "}

      We believe that there is a massive unmet need for high quality content in the
      K-12 market.

      <p className='text-[#475467] text-[16px] sm:text-xl py-4'>
      Uolo partners with both textbook content developers (publishers) and digital
      first content developers to take their offerings to students.

      <p className='text-[#475467] text-[16px] sm:text-xl py-4'>
      Uolo helps content developers to take their content offerings to more than 2
million K-12 students on the Uolo Platform. On a select basis Uolo can also
co-create digital products around the proprietary content of the developer.
